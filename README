Library for reading OSM files in PBF format, extracting a graph topology and wring it to a shape file


Files in osmpbf are the master definition of the PBF protocol and were downloaded from https://github.com/scrosby/OSM-binary/tree/master/src

Those sites I found convenient to download data from:
* http://download.geofabrik.de/
* http://planet.openstreetmap.org/pbf/

For a full list of data provider sites: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm

osmpbfreader.h as well as some of the code in readgraph.h was downloaded from: https://github.com/CanalTP/libosmpbfreader

Original description of the format: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format

Dependencies:
* ZLIB: for extracting data from pbf files
* PROTOBUF: for the same reason
* GDAL: is optional, if you want to have a capability to generate a shapefile
* Boost: graph library is used as an example
